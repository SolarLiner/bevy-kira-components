//! # Custom audio sources
//!
//! ## A solemn forewarning
//!
//! Hark, ye who tread the path of the auditory arts, heed this scroll's solemn words, for they
//! unveil the treacherous pitfalls lurking within the realm of audio programming. As you embark on
//! your quest to weave procedural sound effects into the tapestry of existence, beware the siren
//! song of complexity that ensnares the unwary programmer. Beneath the guise of enchanting harmonies
//! lies the labyrinthine maze of real-time programming, where even the most seasoned minstrels may
//! lose themselves amidst the tangled webs of treacherous ways.
//!
//! Venture forth with vigilance, for in the realm of audio programming lies the challenge of
//! minimizing allocations. Beware the temptation to squander precious resources in the pursuit of
//! convenience, for each unnecessary allocation is a shackle binding thy creations to the
//! dreaded behemoth of thread scheduling. Strive instead to compose thy code with the elegance
//! of a virtuoso, orchestrating symphonies that sing with the clarity of unburdened thread
//! execution.
//!
//! As you seek to craft your incantations that transcend the limitations of earthly constraints,
//! embrace the art of wait-free and lock-free programming. Let not thy magic be marred by the
//! discord of contention and delay, but instead, harmonize thy algorithms with the rhythm of
//! seamless execution. With patience and precision, mayhaps ye shall unlock the secrets of audio
//! programming's true potential, weaving melodies that echo through the ages.
//!
//! Finally, let not thy pride blind thee to the wisdom of collaboration, for in unity lies strength.
//! Though the solitary path may seem enticing, remember that no bard is an island unto themselves.
//! Seek counsel from fellow travelers versed in the arcane arts of memory management and concurrency
//! control, and together, mayhaps ye shall compose masterpieces that resound with the echoes of
//! eternity.
//!
//! Behold, for a tome of further wisdom awaits your perusal [here]. Inscribe these words upon your
//! heart, and let them kindle the fires of resilience within. Tread this path at your own rhythm,
//! for it is not the speed of the journey, but the steadfastness of purpose that shall empower thee.

//! # Implementing a custom sound
//!
//! ## Audio generation
//!
//! The most basic custom audio source implementation is to simply implement [`Sound`], which
//! is where the actual audio generation will happen. Every time this function gets called, a new
//! pair of stereo audio samples (called a `Frame` in Kira) is generated, which corresponds to
//! the position of the speaker cone at that instant. Much like physics, for example, sound is
//! computed at regular intervals, though much faster than physics, since it usually runs at
//! around 44-48 kHz. Each sample, then, only represent a few microseconds of time.
//!
//! ## Control
//!
//! To be useful in the vast majority of cases, you'll want your sound generation to be
//! controllable from the outside world (i.e. the ECS). This is where things get tricky, because a
//! lot of solutions that exist for inter-thread communications (i.e. channels, mutexes, etc.) are
//! invalid within the realm of real-time programming. Instead, the most common solution is to
//! send events or commands through a fixed-size ring buffer.
//!
//! This is the solution used within Kira, and here below. the various setter methods that you
//! will implement will not directly change the value in the [`Sound`] implementation, but
//! instead create a command indicating the change, to be sent to the audio thread through the
//! ring-buffer.
//!
//! Then, on the audio side, within the [`Sound`] implementation, the ring-buffer is consumed for
//! any sent commands to be applied. You can easily send raw values, as well as Kira modulators
//! and tweens, and Kira provides a [`Parameter`] struct which seamlessly integrates with those,
//! in such a way that you only have to consume the events and pass the values to the parameter.
//!
//! To clearly mark the separation of concerns, as well as the ownership of each half by
//! different threads, the audio processing-side type (here [`SineWaveSound`]) and the ECS-side
//! type (here [`SineWaveHandle`]) are separate, and only require access to their half of the
//! ring-buffer (which, here, is seen as a single-producer, single-consumer queue). The handle
//! pushes commands (here of type [`SineWaveCommand`]) into the ring-buffer, and the sound pulls
//! from it and applies the commands.
//!
//! Note that there is nothing to implement for the handle, as it is entirely dependent on the
//! applicable parameters and
//!
//! Most of the code of the handle is to provide a nice user-facing API, which hides the
//! ring-buffer as an implementation detail.
//!
//! ## Data
//!
//! In order to be constructed, you'll most probably require your user to provide initial
//! value, data (such as audio data from samples), as well as settings related to routing the audio
//! to a track or to a spatial scene. This "settings type" should implement [`SoundData`], whose
//! only job is to construct the [`Sound`] and its associated handle, so that Kira knows how to
//! work with your custom sound implementation. This type is not going to be used by end-users,
//! it's only the middle step in bridging the ECS and the audio engine.
//!
