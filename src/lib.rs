//! Add audio support to Bevy through the [`kira`] crate.
//!
//! This crate aims at creating a replacement for `bevy_audio` by instead integrating Kira, a crate
//! for audio playback aimed at games, and used in several other Rust projects.
//!
//! This particular crate is an experiment in making a component-based ECS API, instead of a
//! resource-based approach, currently taken by `bevy_kira_audio`.
//!
//! To get started playing sounds, insert an [`AudioBundle`](prelude::AudioBundle) on an entity.
//! This is a generic bundle which supports any compatible sound source. An implementation over
//! audio files is provided, with streaming support, using the
//! [`AudioFileBundle`](prelude::AudioFileBundle) type alias.
//!
//! When an [`AudioFile`](prelude::AudioFile) is inserted, its playback will begin right away. To
//! prevent that, use the [`start_paused`](prelude::AudioFileSettings) field from
//! [`AudioFileBundle::settings`](prelude::AudioFileBundle::settings) and set it to false.
//!
//! The audio system creates an [`AudioHandle`](prelude::AudioHandle) component when registering an
//! added sound for
//! playback. This handle allows you to control the sound. For [`AudioFile`](prelude::AudioFile)s,
//! this means pausing/resuming, setting the volume, panning, and playback rate of the sound.
//!
//! Spatial audio is supported built-in with the [`SpatialEmitter`](prelude::SpatialEmitter)
//! component, which tells the plugin to add the entity as an emitter, provided it also has a
//! [`GlobalTransform`] component attached. Its settings control the behavior of the spatial effect.
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use bevy::prelude::*;
//! use bevy_kira_components::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     App::new()
//!         .insert_non_send_resource(AudioSettings {
//!             // Only needed for tests
//!             backend_settings: AudioBackendSelector::Mock { sample_rate: 48000, },
//!             ..default()
//!         })
//!         .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, AudioPlugin))
//!         .add_systems(Startup, add_sound)
//!         .run();
//! }
//!
//! fn add_sound(mut commands: Commands, asset_server: Res<AssetServer>) {
//!     commands.spawn(AudioFileBundle {
//!         source: asset_server.load("my_sound.ogg"),
//!         ..default()
//!     });
//! }
//! ```
